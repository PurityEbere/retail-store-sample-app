# InnovateMart

A e-commerce retail application deployed via Kubernetes on Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Each application sub part is defined via helm charts, and connected to a single-point HEML file. The helm charts allow for the applications to be deployed to Kubernetes.

The entire infrastructure and application deployment is managed via terraform and automated via Github actions. The terraform entrypoint file allows for a single automated terraform apply command to be run on Github actions.

### Kubernetes

This deployment method will run the application in an existing Kubernetes cluster.

Pre-requisites:

- Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` installed locally

Use `kubectl` to run the application:

```
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-app/releases/latest/download/kubernetes.yaml
kubectl wait --for=condition=available deployments --all
```

Get the URL for the frontend load balancer like so:

```
kubectl get svc ui
```

To remove the application use `kubectl` again:

```
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-app/releases/latest/download/kubernetes.yaml
```

### Terraform

The following options are available to deploy the application using Terraform:

| Name                                             | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Amazon EKS](./terraform/eks/default/)           | Deploys the application to Amazon EKS using other AWS services for dependencies, such as RDS, DynamoDB etc.     |
| [Amazon EKS (Minimal)](./terraform/eks/minimal/) | Deploys the application to Amazon EKS using in-cluster dependencies instead of RDS, DynamoDB etc.               |
| [Amazon ECS](./terraform/ecs/default/)           | Deploys the application to Amazon ECS using other AWS services for dependencies, such as RDS, DynamoDB etc.     |
| [AWS App Runner](./terraform/apprunner/)         | Deploys the application to AWS App Runner using other AWS services for dependencies, such as RDS, DynamoDB etc. |
